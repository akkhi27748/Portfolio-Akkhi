                <p>I'm Akhilesh Upadhyaya, a recent Computer Science Engineering graduate with a passion for technology and
                    a drive to
                    make a meaningful impact. I've just embarked on my professional journey, armed with a Bachelor's degree
                    in CSE.</p>
    
                <p>During my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, honed my
                    problem-solving skills, and embraced the world of programming. I'm excited to apply the knowledge I've
                    gained to real-world challenges.</p>
    
                <p>I have a strong knowledge in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is
                    to become a
                    full-stack developer by expanding my skills to include back-end technologies, databases, and server
                    management.</p>
    
                <p>I'm eager to learn and grow in the world of web development, and I'm open to internships, entry-level
                    positions, and
                    collaboration on exciting projects that will help me achieve my goal.
                <p>
    
                <p>Let's connect and explore potential opportunities or collaborations. I'm just an email away at
                    akhileshupadhyaya12@gmail.com.<br><br>
                    Looking forward to connecting with you and being a part of the tech community!</p>
